Time is perhaps the most common way to trigger a new habit.
Common morning habits are just one example.
Waking up in the morning usually triggers a cascade of habits: go to the bathroom, take a shower, brush your teeth, get dressed, make a cup of coffee, etc.
There are also less commonly recognized ways that time triggers our behavior.
For example, if you pay attention you may notice that you repeat certain tasks mindlessly at different points during the day: heading off to get a snack at the same time each afternoon, taking a smoking break at the same time each morning, and so on.
If these patterns are bad habits, then you may want to take stock of how you feel at this time of day.
In many cases, your habits are a signal of how you feel.
Bored? Maybe your afternoon snacking habit is a way of breaking up the monotony of the day.
Feeling lonely? Maybe your smoking break is a way to connect with fellow co-workers.
The point is, if you understand the reason why these habits pop up at the same time each day, then it can become easier to find a new habit to fill the void.
Bad habits are replaced, not eliminated.
